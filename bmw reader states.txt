States:
 waiting_for_start -> waiting_for_len when received 1 byte
 waiting_for_len -> waiting_for_dest when received byte > 0 (or 3?)
                 -> lost_sync when byte == 0
 waiting_for_dest -> building_msg
 building_msg -> building_msg if more bytes needed
              -> waiting_fo_xor if enough bytes retrieved
 waiting_for_xor -> waiting_for_start if all bytes received and succesful
                 -> lost_sync if parse failed. skip a byte. 
 lost_sync -> lost_sync if current byte can not be rebuilt into a full message 
           -> lost_sync if not enough bytes
           -> waiting_for_start if current (and next?) message can be reconstructed
